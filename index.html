      <p>November is National Adoption Month which was intended to raise awareness of children in the foster care system who are still needing homes. The troubling fact of the matter is, that this is mostly pushed out by adoption agencies, who have a
        fair amount of financial stake in parents looking to adopt. Adoption is an 8 billion dollar industry, costing both adoptive parents and natural mothers alike, while agencies and lawyers pocket the cash. What's more, the idea that "so many
        children need to be adopted" is rather distorted.</p>
      <p>“There are definitely more children waiting for a forever home in foster care than adoptive couples looking to adopt the older children,” says Michelle Downard, who is a counselor for natural mothers at a private adoption agency, American
        Adoptions. She says what is different about private adoptions, rather than working through the state, is that birth mothers come to them having already decided that placing their child up for adoption is what they want, and that they only
        place children under the age of four. The upside of this, is that this tends to take less time as it is more of a match-making process with readily available parents. However, it is much more costly to the adoptive parents – incurring upwards
        of <a href=https://www.adoptuskids.org/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/what-does-it-cost>$40,000</a> in everything from legal fees to medical care for the natural mother. What is thought of as the more affordable route, is to go through the
        foster care system. However, if the potential parent is looking to adopt an infant, this can take years to arrange.</p>

              <p>As of the end of 2020, there were 15,016 children in foster care in the state of New York, which has hovered around this number since 2019. While this might seem like a large enough number on average, children are in foster care for
                20 months, according to the Adoption and Foster Care and Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). In most cases, children in the state system were taken from their natural parents involuntarily because they were found to be unfit
                parents: financial struggles, drugs, and domestic abuse are among many of these reasons. In New York State, parents have <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/reunification.pdf">15 months</a> to change their circumstances to
                be able to bring their children home. Afterwards, child welfare is required by law to ask the court to take away parental rights, and only then are these children released to be available to be adoption. In addition, for children that
                are 14 or older, the state of New York requires the consent of the child in order for them to become available to be adopted as well. This can explain why of the 15k children in the foster care system, only 699 of them are available
                to be adopted.</p>
              <p>This has not changed the demand for parents looking to adopt, however. Of those 699 children available to be adopted, nearly all of them will find homes with new families. The ratio of parents looking to adopt to children available
                to be adopted remains the same, however. Trump-era laws have made it so that less couples are able to adopt. In 2019, a rule proposed by former President Trump, would make it so that any organization could discriminate against
                LGBTQIA+ couples, preventing them from adopting children. This has come right on the heels of the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/family-first-prevention-services-act-ffpsa.aspx"> Family
                  First Prevention Services Act</a>, which had a goal of overhauling the foster care system to implement services that might help
                keep foster children with their natural parents, making even less children available to prospective adoptive parents</p>
              <p>The adoption system in the US remains largely at the mercy of each state’s cultural perception of adoption and alternative family structures. Abortion bans will likely put more infants into the foster care system. However, if these
                same states are preventing gay couples from adopting, by allowing agencies and Catholic charities to discriminate against them which prevents them from adopting, where is it that the scales will tip, and who will be on the loosing
                side of this ratio?</P>
