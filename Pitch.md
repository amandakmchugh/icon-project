First piece created for Intro to Data Journalism at the Newmark Graduate J-School.

November is National Adoption Month which was created to raise awareness of children in the system who are still needing homes. The troubling fact of the matter is, 
that this is mostly pushed out by adoption agencies, who have a fair amount of financial stake in parents looking to adopt. Adoption is an eight billion dollar industry, 
costing both adoptive parents and natural mothers alike, while agencies and lawyers pocket the cash. What's more, the idea that "so many children need to be adopted" is 
rather distorted. Most parents looking to adopt today are desiring children as infants, however the most children that are actually available to be adopted are above the age
of five and have been in foster care for an average of three years. What I intend to explore in this piece, is which children are readily available to be adopted, and why
they are adopted at a much slower rate.
